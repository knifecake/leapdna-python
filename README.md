An implementation of the leapdna toolkit in Python.

## Installation

leapdna is compatible with Python 3.9 and greater. Install it from PyPI with

    pip install leapdna


## Usage

### Working with data

leapdna aims to provide a way to represent a lot of the data that is normally dealt with in genetics, with a focus on forensic applications. The usual suspects here are loci, alleles, profiles, allele frequency studies... All of these are represented in leapdna by a block. A block is a Python class which can be stored as a JSON file with the leapdna format. All blocks inherit from the `Base` block class and define some attributes and functionality of their own. For instance, a `Locus` block has a `name` attribute, in addition to a `band` attribute, which specifies the [chromosome band](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Class/MLACourse/Original8Hour/Genetics/chrombanding.html "NCBI article on chromosome banding and nomenclature") where the locus is. Other `Locus` blocks will have different values for these attributes while other types of blocks, such as `Allele`, will have a different set of attributes altogether. The documentation details which attributes are supported (and sometimes required) for a particular block type.

```python
from leapdna.blocks import Allele, Locus


l1 = Locus('L1')
a1 = Allele(name='a1', locus=l1)
```

leapdna aims to be extensible, so it allows you to specify your own attributes in any kind of block. If you wanted to mark a locus as a potential carrier of a diseas you could do

```python
l1.user['carrier'] = True
```

## Testing

To run the leapdna test suite execute

```bash
python3 -m unittest
```

from the root of the leapdna repository. Test coverage can be calculated with the `coverage` Python package. To do so, first run the tests with `coverage run --source leapdna -m unittest discover` and then get the report with `coverage report -m`.

In addition, leapdna comes with type annotations which allows for running it through a type checker such as `mypy`. This can be done by executing `mypy leapdna` from the root of the repository. If you do not have `mypy` installed you may do so with `python3 -m pip install mypy`.
